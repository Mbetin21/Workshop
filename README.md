## Workshop-1 (Solution-1)

This workshop consists of developing a CLI application for an electronics store. You will collect feedback from 15 students about desired functionalities in a catalog of electronic devices and use that information to create user stories, which are implemented in the code along with functionalities such as adding products to the cart, and making payments with delivery information. Additionally a detailed report will be prepared including user stories, object oriented programming principles, and some UML diagrams.

- __Code__ : Here is presented the software development related to the problem posed.
- __Document__ : This PDF document is the Workshop-1 technical report, which includes the user stories and UML diagrams of the project.


## Workshop-2
It focuses on proposing the identification of essential classes, as well as their respective responsibilities and methods, to build an application that manages products and users efficiently. Through the use of diagrams and the drafting of adequate documentation, it is possible to design a system that is functional and complies with the established requirements, thus facilitating the software development process. The importance of testing and validation of the system to ensure its proper functioning is also addressed. They developed practical skills in the construction and documentation of object-oriented applications.
